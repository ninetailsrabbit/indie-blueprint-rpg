# Probability

## Dice roller ðŸŽ²

## Loot ðŸ’°

`Lootie` serves as a tool for game developers to define and manage the random generation of loot items within their games. It allows specifying a list of available items with their respective weights or rarity tiers, enabling the generation of loot with controlled probabilities.

The class offers various methods for adding, removing, and manipulating the loot items, along with three primary generation methods: `weight-based`, `roll-tier based` and `chance_based`

### Creating a new loot table.

To create a new table it's simple to add the node in the desired scene via editor:

#### LootTableData

This resource allows you to set the parameters for the `LootieTable` needs to generate the loot. As resource it can be reused so you can create it once and save it in your project.

```swift
class_name LootTableData extends Resource

enum ProbabilityMode {
	Weight, // The type of probability technique to apply on a loot, weight is the common case and generate random decimals while each time sum the weight of the next item.
	RollTier, //  The roll tier uses a max roll number and define a number range for each tier.
	PercentageProbability, // A standard chance based on percentages,
	WeightRollTierCombined, // The item needs to overcome a weight and roll tier to be looted
	WeightPercentageCombined, // The item needs to overcome a weight and percentage roll to be looted
	RollTierPercentageCombined, // The item needs to overcome a roll tier and percentage roll to be looted
	WeightPercentageRollTierCombined // The items needs to overcome all the probability modes to be looted
}

// The available items that will be used on a roll for this loot table
@export var available_items: Array[LootItem] = []

// The probability mode that set the rules to generate items from this table
@export var probability_mode: ProbabilityMode = ProbabilityMode.Weight

// The type of roll, when this is enabled the roll result will be executed per items instead of one per generation time
@export var roll_per_item: bool = false

// When this is enabled items can be repeated for multiple rolls on this generation
@export var allow_duplicates: bool = false

// Max items that this loot table can generate. Set to 0 to disable it and does not apply a limit in the loot generation
@export var items_limit_per_loot: int = 3

// When this is enabled, the "always drop items" count on the loot limit for this table.
@export var always_drop_items_count_on_limit: bool = false

// Each time a random number between min_roll_tier and max roll will be generated, based on this result if the number
// fits on one of the rarity roll ranges, items of this rarity will be picked randomly
@export var min_roll_tier: float = 0.0

// Each time a random number between min_roll_tier and max roll will be generated, based on this result if the number
// fits on one of the rarity roll ranges, items of this rarity will be picked randomly
@export var max_roll_tier: float = 100.0

// The max roll value will be clamped to the maximum that can be found in the items available for this loot table.
// So if you set this value to 100 and in the items the maximun found it's 80, this last will be used instead of 100
@export var limit_max_roll_tier_from_available_items: bool = false

// Set to zero to not use it. This has priority over seed_string. Define a seed for this loot table. Doing so will give you deterministic results across runs
@export var seed_value: int = 0

// Set it to empty to not use it. Define a seed string that will be hashed to use for deterministic results
@export var seed_string: String = ""

// You can set items when creating this resource via GDScript, it accept an array of Dictionaries that represent an item or the LootItem resource
// LootTableData.new([...])
func _init(items: Array[Variant] = []) -> void

```

#### LootItem

This is a resource that act as a wrapper for your original items in-game, provides a series of parameters that will be important for the `LootieTable` to perform the calculations and obtain this items.

The `LootieTable` returns this resource in all generations so extracting the item information depends on the logic of your game.

- When the `ProbabilityMode` is set to `Weight` the `LootItemWeight` resource needs to be set
- When the `ProbabilityMode` is set to `RollTier` the `LootItemRarity` resource needs to be set _(if you want that item to be obtainable by rarity)_
- When the `ProbabilityMode` is set to `PercentageProbability` the `LootItemChance` resource needs to be set
- When the `Probability` is any of `Combined` modes, the related resources needs to be set to make this item available in the loot.

This resources aditionally **can be created from a dictionary**, in this case, all values are optional and invalid keys will be ignored. The keys are converted to `snake_case` in the process so a key defined as `"iD"` will still be valid

```swift
LootItem.create_from({"id": "sword_1", "name": "Sword", "weight": LootItem.Weight.new(5.5) })
LootItem.create_from({"iD": "potion", "rarity": LootItemRarity.new(LootItemRarity.ItemRarity.Common, 0, 50) })
```

---

```swift
class_name LootItem extends Resource

// Unique identifier for this item
@export var id: String = ""

// An optional file path that represents this item
@export_file var file

// An optional scene that represents this item
@export var scene: PackedScene

// The name of the item
@export var name : String

// A shortcut to display the name in short form for limited ui in screen
@export var abbreviation : String

// A description more detailed about this item
@export_multiline var description : String

// Indicates whether this item should drop every time a loot is requested or not.
@export var should_drop_always: bool = false

// When enabled the item is eligible on loot generations
@export var is_enabled: bool = true

// The item is removed from the loot table when looted
@export var is_unique: bool = false

// The weight parameters for this item
@export var weight: LootItemWeight

// The grade of rarity for this item
@export var rarity: LootItemRarity

// The chance percentage for this item
@export var chance: LootItemChance

```

#### LootItemWeight

This is a simple resource that holds a value for the weight of this item. The higher the `weight` value, the more likely it is to come out. The `accum_weight` variable is used internally by the loot table for the related calculations, **It is recommended not to manipulate it**

```swift
class_name LootItemWeight extends Resource

// The weight value for this items to appear in a loot, the more the weight, more the chance to be looted
@export var value: float = 1.0

var accum_weight: float = 0.0
```

#### LootItemRarity

This is a simple resource to set the rules for the rarity of an item. The `min_roll` and `max_roll` is the range where this item can be obtained when the LootieTable makes a roll and generates a random value. This will be explained later but simply if it is between the `min_roll = 1` and `max_roll= 5`, a result of `3.5` would be valid to obtain this item and a `5.1` would not.

```swift
class_name LootItemRarity extends Resource

// Expand here as to adjust it to your game requirements
enum ItemRarity { COMMON, UNCOMMON, RARE, EPIC, LEGENDARY, MYTHIC, ETERNAL, ABYSSAL, COSMIC, DIVINE}

// The rarity definition
@export var rarity: ItemRarity = ItemRarity.COMMON

// The minimum value in range to be available on the roll pick
@export var min_roll: float

// The maximum value in range to be available on the roll pick
@export var max_roll: float
```

#### LootItemChance

This is a simple resource that holds a percentage value between `0` and `1.0` and a `deviation` that could increase or decrease the chance in a roll.

```swift
class_name LootItemChance extends Resource

// Set to zero to disable it. Chance in percentage to appear in a loot from 0 to 1.0, where 0.05 means 5% and 1.0 means 100%
@export_range(0.0, 1.0, 0.001) var value: float = 0.0

// A deviation to alter the results of this item by making it easier (-) or more difficult (+).
@export_range(-1.0, 1.0, 0.001) var deviation: float = 0.0

```

### Adding items to a LootieTable

This operation can be done **from the editor** or via script

**_From the editor:_**

![add_loot_item_editor](images/add_loot_item.png)

---

**_From a script_**:

```swift
extends Node

@onready var lootie_table: LootieTable = $LootieTable

func _ready() -> void:
	// Multiple items at once
	lootie_table.add_items([LootItem.new(...), LootItem.new(...), LootItem.new(...)])

	// Individually
	lootie_table.add_item(LootItem.new(...))

	// The not recommended way to add new items
	lootie_table.loot_table_data.available_items.append(LootItem.new(...))
	lootie_table.loot_table_data.available_items.append_array([LootItem.new(...), LootItem.new(...), LootItem.new(...)])

	//Remove items by passing an Array of resources or ids
	lootie_table.remove_items([LootItem1, LootItem2])
	lootie_table.remove_items_by_id("sword_1", "basic_potion")

	//Remove item by passing the resource or the id
	lootie_table.remove_item(LootItem)
	lootie_table.remove_item_by_id("sword_1")
```

### Generating loot ðŸŽ²

The function `generate(times: int = 1)` it's the only thing you need, it accepts a number of `times` to roll.

The `LootieTable` uses the `LootTableData` that it uses as rules to generate loot based on the selected mode, **depending on your rules** it is possible for a roll **to return an empty array.** To avoid this you can set to true the variable `should_drop_always` in the items you want to always be looted.

```swift
var items_rolled: Array[LootItem] = lootie_table.generate() // Roll times set on default value
// Or
var items_rolled: Array[LootItem] = lootie_table.generate(10) // Roll 10 times so they are more chances to appear items in the loot

// You can change the probability type before rolling again
lootie_table.change_probability_type(LootTableData.ProbabilityMode.RollTier)

var items_rolled: Array[LootItem] = lootie_table.generate(3)

```

#### Using Weight mode

`weight` needs to be greater than zero on each `LootItem` to be valid for this roll

This method iterates through the available items, calculating their accumulative weights and randomly selecting items based on the accumulated weight values. It repeats this process for the specified `times` parameter, potentially returning up to `items_limit_per_loot` items while considering the `allow_duplicates` flag.

**The more the weight of the item, the more chances to appear in the loot**.

You can set the `extra_weight_bias` to increase the difficulty to generate the loot using `weight_mode`, this could be used to start with a high value and decrease it as the player progresses through the game e.g.

#### Using RollTier mode

**The items needs to have a `LootItemRarity` set to be valid for this roll**

This method generates random numbers within the specified `max_roll` range and compares them to the defined rarity tiers of the available items. Based on the roll results, it randomly selects items corresponding to the matching rarity tiers, repeating for the specified times parameter and potentially returning up to `items_limit_per_loot` while considering the `allow_duplicates` flag

As you notice in `LootItemRarity` there are two properties that works as a range:

- `min_roll`: The minimum roll value to be valid as posibly generated
- `max_roll`: The maximum roll value to be valid as posibly generated.

So if my item has a `min_roll` of 5 and `max_roll` of 20. Only values between 5 and 20 in each roll tier generation will be valid to return this item.

Higher roll ranges for an item in `roll_tier` generations means more probabilities to be returned.

Imagine I defined a `LootTable` with a `max_roll` of 100, so in each generation a random number between 0-100 will be randomly calculated. If the number is 7.55, items where this number falls within the valid range will be candidates for return.

#### Using PercentageChance

**The items needs to have a `LootItemChance` set to be valid for this roll**

This method uses `randf()` to generate a value between 0 and 1.0. If this value after applying the `deviation` is below the chance value for the item, it will go into the loot.

- Higher chance value for an item means more probabilities to be returned.
- A deviation to alter the results of this item by making it easier (-) or more difficult (+).

#### Using Combined

Any method with the `Combined` suffix will apply the same algorithms explained above but in this case the item must pass all the rolls in the combined methods.

So for example if `WeightRollTierCombined` is selected, the item must overcome a `weight` and a `roll tier` roll to appear in the loot.

**Note that items that are valid for these combined methods must have the related resources created in the `LootItem`**
